Description: Lattice functions for drawing folded empirical cumulative
    distribution plots, or mountain plots. A mountain plot is similar to
    an empirical CDF plot, except that the curve increases from 0 to 0.5,
    then decreases from 0.5 to 1 using an inverted scale at the right
    side. See Monti (1995) <doi:10.1080/00031305.1995.10476179>.

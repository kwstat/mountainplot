Description: Lattice functions for drawing folded empirical cumulative
    distribution plots, or mountain plots. A mountain plot is similar
    to an empirical CDF plot, except that the curve increases from
    0 to 0.5, then decreases from 0.5 to 1 using an inverted scale at
    the right side. See Monti (1995) <doi:10.1080/00031305.1995.10476179>.
